# Institutional Memory: Architectural Decisions

*Human architectural decisions captured from actual project work, showing how the system learns and applies established patterns.*

## Authentication System Decisions

### Decision Codified: JWT Authentication Standard
**Date**: 2024-09-06  
**Context**: User authentication system for customer portal project  
**Human Decision**: JWT with OAuth2 integration, TOTP 2FA required for admin roles  
**Agent Proposals Considered**:  
- Senior Architect: JWT vs session-based auth, OAuth2 vs custom implementation  
- Security Consultant: 2FA options (TOTP, SMS, hardware keys), session management  
**Rationale**: Scalability needs for multi-service architecture + compliance requirements  
**Scope**: All future authentication systems use this pattern  
**Application**: Subsequently applied to payment service, admin dashboard, API gateway

### Decision Codified: Database Architecture Pattern  
**Date**: 2024-08-15  
**Context**: E-commerce microservices data architecture  
**Human Decision**: PostgreSQL primary with Redis caching, separate databases per service  
**Agent Proposals Considered**:  
- Senior Architect: Shared database vs database-per-service, SQL vs NoSQL options  
- Security Consultant: Data encryption, backup strategies, compliance considerations  
**Rationale**: Data consistency requirements + service autonomy + proven technology stack  
**Scope**: All microservices follow this database pattern  
**Application**: Applied to user service, product catalog, order processing, inventory management

## Security Standards Decisions

### Decision Codified: API Security Requirements
**Date**: 2024-09-01  
**Context**: Public API development for partner integrations  
**Human Decision**: OAuth2 client credentials + rate limiting + comprehensive audit logging  
**Agent Proposals Considered**:  
- Security Consultant: API key vs OAuth2, rate limiting strategies, monitoring approaches  
- Senior Architect: Performance impact of security measures, integration complexity  
**Rationale**: Partner security requirements + audit compliance + scalability needs  
**Scope**: All external-facing APIs must meet these security standards  
**Application**: Partner API, webhook endpoints, mobile app API

### Decision Codified: Frontend Security Standards
**Date**: 2024-08-20  
**Context**: Customer-facing web application security  
**Human Decision**: Content Security Policy (CSP) + SameSite cookies + XSS protection headers  
**Agent Proposals Considered**:  
- Security Consultant: CSP strictness levels, cookie security options, XSS prevention strategies  
- UX Strategist: Impact on third-party integrations and user experience  
**Rationale**: Security compliance + user data protection + minimal UX impact  
**Scope**: All customer-facing applications follow these security patterns  
**Application**: Main web app, customer portal, mobile web interface

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Decision Codified: Frontend Technology Standard
**Date**: 2024-08-10  
**Context**: New web application development  
**Human Decision**: React with TypeScript + Next.js for SSR + Tailwind CSS for styling  
**Agent Proposals Considered**:  
- Senior Architect: React vs Vue vs Angular, SSR frameworks, styling solutions  
- UX Strategist: Performance implications, accessibility support, design system integration  
**Rationale**: Team expertise + performance requirements + design system compatibility  
**Scope**: All new frontend projects use this technology stack  
**Application**: Customer portal, admin dashboard, marketing website, mobile web app

### Decision Codified: Backend Technology Standard  
**Date**: 2024-07-25  
**Context**: Microservices architecture for scalable API development  
**Human Decision**: Node.js with Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Docker containerization  
**Agent Proposals Considered**:  
- Senior Architect: Node.js vs Python vs Go, framework options, containerization strategies  
- Security Consultant: Runtime security, dependency management, container security  
**Rationale**: Development velocity + team skills + ecosystem maturity + deployment flexibility  
**Scope**: All backend services follow this technology pattern  
**Application**: User service, payment service, notification service, analytics service

## Process Improvement Decisions

### Decision Codified: Code Review Process
**Date**: 2024-08-30  
**Context**: Quality assurance for production deployments  
**Human Decision**: Multi-agent validation (Security + Architecture + Domain Expert) before production  
**Agent Proposals Considered**:  
- Senior Architect: Review complexity vs development velocity trade-offs  
- Security Consultant: Security review depth requirements, automation possibilities  
**Rationale**: Production quality requirements + risk mitigation + learning opportunities  
**Scope**: All production code changes require multi-agent validation  
**Application**: Applied to all services with zero production security issues since implementation

### Decision Codified: Documentation Standards
**Date**: 2024-09-05  
**Context**: Team onboarding and knowledge sharing  
**Human Decision**: API documentation + architecture decision records + runbook documentation required  
**Agent Proposals Considered**:  
- Senior Architect: Documentation tooling options, automation possibilities  
- UX Strategist: Documentation usability and developer experience  
**Rationale**: Team scaling needs + knowledge retention + operational efficiency  
**Scope**: All projects must include comprehensive documentation  
**Application**: Established documentation templates now reused across all projects
