# Team Decision Voting & Approval System

*Systematic approach for building consensus and making team decisions efficiently*

## Decision Categories & Voting Requirements

### Category 1: Technical Architecture (High Impact)
**Examples**: Technology stack, database choice, major framework decisions
**Voting Required**: 75% team approval + Technical Lead final authority
**Timeline**: 2 weeks discussion + 1 week voting
**Participants**: All senior developers + Technical Lead

```markdown
## Architecture Decision Voting Template

### Decision: [Technology Choice]
**Voting Period**: [Start Date] to [End Date]
**Required Approval**: 75% of eligible voters (minimum 3 votes)

**Eligible Voters**:
- [x] Technical Lead (Final Authority)
- [x] Senior Developer 1
- [x] Senior Developer 2  
- [ ] Mid-level developers (advisory votes)

**Options**:
A) [Option 1]: [Brief description]
B) [Option 2]: [Brief description]  
C) [Option 3]: [Brief description]

**Vote Tracking**:
| Voter | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Tech Lead | A | [Reasoning] |
| Sr Dev 1 | B | [Reasoning] |  
| Sr Dev 2 | A | [Reasoning] |

**Result**: Option A approved (2/3 = 67% - Tech Lead authority applies)
**Implementation Date**: [When decision takes effect]
```

### Category 2: Process Standards (Medium Impact) 
**Examples**: Code review process, git workflow, testing requirements
**Voting Required**: Simple majority (50%+) of team
**Timeline**: 1 week discussion + 3 days voting
**Participants**: All team members with equal vote weight

```markdown
## Process Decision Voting Template

### Decision: [Process Change]
**Voting Period**: [Start Date] to [End Date]  
**Required Approval**: Simple majority of team

**Team Vote**:
- [ ] **Approve**: Implement proposed process
- [ ] **Modify**: Implement with suggested changes
- [ ] **Reject**: Keep current process

**Vote Summary**:
| Team Member | Vote | Comments |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Developer 1 | Approve | Works well for our workflow |
| Developer 2 | Modify | Suggest daily standups instead of weekly |
| Developer 3 | Approve | Will improve our efficiency |

**Result**: 2 Approve, 1 Modify = **APPROVED** with modification consideration
**Modification Consensus**: Daily standups adopted based on feedback
```

### Category 3: Style & Tools (Low Impact)
**Examples**: Linting rules, editor preferences, naming conventions  
**Voting Required**: Consensus preferred, Technical Lead decides if no agreement
**Timeline**: 3 days discussion + 2 days voting
**Participants**: All developers, weighted by usage frequency

```markdown
## Style Decision Quick Vote

### Decision: [Style/Tool Choice]
**Quick Vote**: [Date] (48 hour turnaround)

**Options & Votes**:
- **Option A**: ████░ (4 votes) - [Brief rationale]
- **Option B**: ██░░░ (2 votes) - [Brief rationale]  
- **Option C**: █░░░░ (1 vote) - [Brief rationale]

**Result**: Option A selected (majority preference)
**Effective**: Immediately for new code
**Migration**: Gradual as code is touched
```

## Voting Methods by Team Size

### Small Team (2-5 developers)
- **In-person discussion** during team meetings
- **Slack poll** for quick decisions  
- **Email thread** for complex decisions requiring research
- **Decision timeline**: 3-7 days total

### Medium Team (6-12 developers)  
- **GitHub Discussion** threads for proposals
- **Slack polls** with discussion threads
- **Team meeting presentations** for major decisions
- **Decision timeline**: 1-2 weeks total

### Large Team (13+ developers)
- **RFC (Request for Comments)** process for major decisions
- **Structured voting platform** (GitHub, Jira, custom tool)
- **Working group recommendations** for complex technical decisions
- **Decision timeline**: 2-4 weeks total

## Decision Authority Framework

### Technical Lead Authority
```markdown
**Final Authority On**:
- Architecture decisions (can override team vote if technical reasons)
- Security requirements (non-negotiable standards)
- Performance requirements (when business impact clear)
- Third-party service selections (vendor decisions)

**Must Respect Team Vote On**:
- Development process preferences (workflows, tools)
- Code style conventions (formatting, naming)
- Meeting schedules and communication preferences
- Work-from-home and collaboration policies

**Veto Power Only For**:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance regressions  
- Architectural inconsistencies
- Budget/resource constraints
```

### Team Consensus Required For
```markdown
**Process Changes**:
- How code reviews are conducted
- Git branching strategies  
- Testing coverage requirements
- Documentation standards

**Quality Standards**:
- Definition of "done" for features
- Code coverage thresholds
- Performance benchmarks
- Error handling patterns

**Communication Changes**:
- Meeting frequency and format
- Notification preferences
- Issue tracking workflows
- Status reporting methods
```

## Emergency Decision Process

### Critical Issues (Security, Outages, Blockers)
```markdown
**Timeline**: Decision within 24 hours
**Authority**: Technical Lead or on-call engineer
**Process**: 
1. **Immediate action** taken to resolve issue
2. **Team notification** within 4 hours of decision
3. **Rationale documentation** within 24 hours
4. **Team review** within 1 week to validate or adjust

**Example**: Security vulnerability discovered in production
- **Immediate**: Deploy hotfix, disable affected feature
- **Notify**: "Emergency patch deployed for CVE-2024-XXXX"  
- **Document**: Root cause, fix details, prevention measures
- **Review**: Team validates approach, updates security process
```

### Blocking Decisions (Development Stopped)
```markdown
**Timeline**: Decision within 3 days
**Authority**: Technical Lead with expedited team input
**Process**:
1. **Issue escalated** to Technical Lead immediately
2. **Team input** requested within 24 hours  
3. **Decision made** within 72 hours maximum
4. **Implementation** begins immediately after decision

**Example**: CI/CD pipeline broken, deployments blocked
- **Escalate**: "All deployments blocked, need immediate solution"
- **Options**: Fix current pipeline vs. switch to backup vs. manual deploy
- **Team input**: Preferences and resource availability
- **Decision**: Technical Lead chooses based on risk/timeline trade-offs
```

## Voting Tools & Platforms

### Recommended Tools by Team Setup

#### GitHub-Centric Teams
```markdown
**GitHub Discussions**: Complex proposals with threaded conversations
**GitHub Issues**: Decision tracking with labels and milestones  
**GitHub Projects**: Decision pipeline (Proposed → Discussion → Vote → Implemented)

**Workflow**:
1. Create Discussion for proposal
2. Convert to Issue when ready for vote
3. Use Issue comments for voting
4. Close Issue when implemented
```

#### Slack-Heavy Teams
```markdown
**Slack Polls**: Quick decisions with built-in voting  
**Slack Canvas**: Collaborative decision documents
**Slack Workflow Builder**: Automated decision request routing

**Workflow**:
