# Framework Self-Maintenance Stress Tests

*Comprehensive tests to verify the AI DevOps Framework actively maintains itself, stays current, and evolves correctly over time.*

## Test Suite 1: Context Drift Detection & Correction

### Stress Test 1A: Outdated Context Detection
**Scenario**: Test if framework detects when codebase context is stale

**Setup**:
```bash
# Simulate outdated symbol-index.md
# symbol-index.md says: authenticateUser() in src/services/auth/
# But in reality, function moved to src/auth-service/core.ts
```

**Test Command**:
```
"Claude, modify the user authentication to add password complexity validation"
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
1. **Read symbol-index.md** and reference `authenticateUser()` location
2. **Detect inconsistency** if referenced location doesn't match current codebase
3. **Flag context drift**: "‚ö†Ô∏è CONTEXT VALIDATION REQUIRED - Referenced function location may be outdated"
4. **Request user confirmation**: "Please verify authenticateUser() location before proceeding"
5. **Update symbol-index.md** immediately when user corrects location

**‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS**:
- Proceeds with outdated location without flagging inconsistency
- Doesn't ask user to verify stale context
- Doesn't update symbol-index.md when corrected

---

### Stress Test 1B: Convention Staleness Detection  
**Scenario**: Test if framework recognizes when conventions may be outdated

**Setup**:
```bash
# conventions.md shows "Node.js + Express" decided 2024-08-15
# 6 months later, test if framework questions old decisions
```

**Test Command**:
```
"Claude, create a new microservice for real-time notifications"
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
1. **Apply established conventions** (Node.js + Express)
2. **Flag age concern**: "üìÖ CONVENTION AGE NOTICE: Backend standards established 6+ months ago"
3. **Validate relevance**: "Are Node.js + Express still appropriate for real-time notifications?"
4. **Suggest alternatives**: "Consider: WebSocket servers, event streaming platforms"
5. **Update conventions** if user chooses new approach

**‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS**:
- Blindly applies old conventions without questioning relevance
- Doesn't notice or flag aged decisions
- Doesn't suggest newer alternatives for changed requirements

---

## Test Suite 2: Automatic Convention Evolution

### Stress Test 2A: Pattern Recognition & Codification
**Scenario**: Test if framework automatically recognizes and documents repeated decisions

**Multi-Session Test Sequence**:

**Session 1**:
```
Human: "For this API, use rate limiting of 1000 req/hr per API key"
Claude: [Implements with this rate limit]
Expected: Should note this as potential pattern in üìù CONVENTION UPDATES section
```

**Session 2** (Different project):
```
Human: "Add rate limiting to the user management API - 1000 req/hr per key"
Claude: [Should recognize repeated pattern]
Expected: Should propose documenting rate limiting standard in conventions.md
```

**Session 3** (Different project):
```
Human: "What rate limiting should I use for the payment API?"
Claude: [Should reference established pattern]
Expected: Should suggest 1000 req/hr based on established pattern, ask if this should be codified
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
- **Recognize repetition** across multiple sessions/projects
- **Propose standardization** when pattern emerges 3+ times
- **Auto-update conventions.md** when user confirms pattern should be standard
- **Apply pattern automatically** in future similar requests

---

### Stress Test 2B: Convention Conflict Resolution
**Scenario**: Test framework handling when new decisions conflict with established conventions

**Test Command**:
```
"For this machine learning project, use Python + FastAPI instead of Node.js"
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
1. **Detect conflict** with established Node.js convention
2. **Present options clearly**:
   - Override: Use Python for this project only (exception)
   - Extend: Python for ML projects, Node.js for others (context-specific rule)
   - Replace: Python becomes new standard (replaces Node.js)
3. **Document decision** in conventions.md with proper scope
4. **Update future behavior** based on user choice

**Follow-up Test**:
```
"Create an API for image processing"
```

**Expected**: Should apply ML context rule if that was chosen, or ask for clarification

---

## Test Suite 3: Learning Loop Validation

### Stress Test 3A: Cross-Session Memory
**Scenario**: Test if decisions persist and apply across different sessions

**Session 1**:
```
Human: "We've decided to require code coverage of 90% instead of 80%"
Expected: Claude updates conventions.md immediately
```

**Session 2** (Simulated new session):
```
Human: "Set up testing for the new user service"  
Expected: Claude should automatically apply 90% coverage requirement without re-asking
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
- **Persistent memory** across simulated sessions
- **Automatic application** of updated conventions  
- **No re-asking** for decisions already made and documented

---

### Stress Test 3B: Institutional Knowledge Accumulation
**Scenario**: Test if framework builds genuine institutional knowledge over multiple decisions

**Sequential Decision Test**:

1. **Authentication Decision**: "Use JWT + TOTP 2FA for admin accounts"
2. **Rate Limiting Decision**: "1000 req/hr per API key for external APIs"
3. **Database Decision**: "PostgreSQL with Redis caching for all services"
4. **Testing Decision**: "90% code coverage with Jest + Testing Library"
5. **Deployment Decision**: "Docker containers with health check endpoints"

**Integration Test Command**:
```
"Claude, create a complete admin user management system"
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
- **Apply ALL established conventions** without re-asking
- **Reference multiple decisions** from different time periods
- **Show institutional knowledge**: "Based on established patterns: [list all relevant conventions]"
- **Identify gaps**: "This system needs [missing piece] - should we establish a convention?"

---

## Test Suite 4: Framework Resilience

### Stress Test 4A: Contradictory Information Handling
**Scenario**: Test framework behavior when conventions.md contains conflicting information

**Setup**: Manually inject conflicting conventions:
```markdown
## Backend Standards  
**Decision Made**: 2024-08-15 - Use Node.js + Express
**Decision Made**: 2024-09-01 - Use Python + FastAPI  
```

**Test Command**:
```
"Create a new API service"
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
1. **Detect contradiction** in conventions.md
2. **Flag inconsistency**: "‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICTING CONVENTIONS DETECTED"
3. **Present conflict clearly**: "Node.js (Aug 15) vs Python (Sep 1) - which should apply?"
4. **Request resolution**: "Please clarify current backend standard"
5. **Clean up conventions.md** once user resolves conflict

---

### Stress Test 4B: Partial Context Recovery
**Scenario**: Test framework behavior when project-memory files are incomplete or corrupted

**Setup**:
```bash
# Simulate corrupted conventions.md (malformed markdown, missing sections)
# or missing symbol-index.md entirely
```

**Test Command**:
```
"Claude, add a new feature to the existing user service"
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
1. **Detect missing/corrupted context**: "‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE PROJECT MEMORY"
2. **Request context rebuild**: "Please help rebuild conventions.md with current decisions"
3. **Guided recovery**: Ask systematic questions to rebuild context
4. **Validate recovery**: Confirm rebuilt context is accurate
5. **Resume normal operation** once context is restored

---

## Test Suite 5: Performance & Scale Testing

### Stress Test 5A: Large Convention Set
**Scenario**: Test framework performance with extensive conventions.md (50+ decisions)

**Setup**: Populate conventions.md with 50+ architectural decisions across multiple projects

**Test Command**:
```
"Create a new e-commerce checkout service"
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
- **Read and process** all relevant conventions efficiently
- **Apply multiple conventions** without confusion or conflicts
- **Reference specific decisions** relevant to e-commerce checkout
- **Maintain format requirements** despite large context size

---

### Stress Test 5B: Symbol Index Complexity
**Scenario**: Test framework with complex codebase mapping (100+ functions, deep dependencies)

**Setup**: Create detailed symbol-index.md with extensive function mapping and dependency chains

**Test Command**:
```
"Modify the payment processing flow to add fraud detection"
```

**REQUIRED Framework Behavior**:
- **Navigate complex dependencies** accurately
- **Identify all integration points** that could be affected
- **Propose changes** that maintain existing contracts
- **Update symbol-index.md** with new fraud detection function mapping

---
