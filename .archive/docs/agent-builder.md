## ✅ Quality Validation System

The builder includes comprehensive validation to ensure production-ready agents:

### **Schema Validation**
- **Structure**: Validates required fields and data types
- **Constraints**: Enforces minimum/maximum limits for arrays and strings
- **Format**: Ensures proper naming conventions and version formatting

### **Business Logic Validation**
- **Uniqueness**: Capabilities and values must be unique within categories
- **Completeness**: All required sections must be meaningfully populated
- **Consistency**: Agent configuration must be internally consistent

### **Production Readiness Checks**
- **Methodology Completeness**: All phases must have defined activities
- **Quality Standards**: Quality frameworks must be specified for validation
- **Integration Compatibility**: Configuration must work with orchestration system

```python
from src.orchestrator import MetaOrchestrator

orchestrator = MetaOrchestrator()

# Your custom agent is immediately available
result = orchestrator.coordinate({
    "objective": "Conduct UX research for mobile app",
    "agents": ["senior-ux-researcher"],
    "quality_threshold": 85
})
```

# Built-in quality assessment
print(f"Quality Score: {result.quality_metrics.overall}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.quality_metrics.confidence}")
print(f"Methodology: {result.quality_metrics.methodology_adherence}")
```

### **Production Pipeline**
