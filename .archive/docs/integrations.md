# Framework Integrations

This framework is designed to integrate with various AI providers, development tools, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for enhanced agent capabilities.

## AI Provider Integrations

### OpenAI Integration
```python
from src.orchestrator import MetaOrchestrator

# Configure with OpenAI
orchestrator = MetaOrchestrator()
# Add your OpenAI API key configuration
```

### Anthropic Integration  
```python
# Configure with Claude API
orchestrator = MetaOrchestrator()
# Add your Anthropic API key configuration
```

## MCP Server Integration

The framework supports integration with MCP servers to extend agent capabilities:

### Common MCP Integrations
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation and testing capabilities
- **GitHub MCP**: Repository management and code analysis  
- **Database MCP**: Direct database operations and queries
- **File System MCP**: Advanced file manipulation and analysis

### Example MCP Configuration Template
```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH": "/usr/local/bin"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "mcp-server-github", 
      "args": ["--token", "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent-MCP Integration Pattern
```python
class EnhancedDeveloperAgent:
    def __init__(self, mcp_servers=None):
        self.mcp_servers = mcp_servers or {}
        
    async def execute_with_tools(self, request):
        # Use MCP servers for enhanced capabilities
        if 'playwright' in self.mcp_servers:
            # Browser automation capabilities
            pass
            
        if 'github' in self.mcp_servers:
            # Repository analysis capabilities  
            pass
```

## LangChain Integration

```python
from langchain.agents import Agent
from src.orchestrator import MetaOrchestrator

class LangChainAdapter:
    def __init__(self, orchestrator: MetaOrchestrator):
        self.orchestrator = orchestrator
        
    def create_langchain_agent(self, agent_config):
        # Convert framework agents to LangChain format
        pass
```

## Production Integration Considerations

### Security
- API keys and credentials should be managed through environment variables
- MCP server connections should be authenticated and encrypted
- Agent outputs should be sanitized before external system integration

### Performance  
- Connection pooling for external services
- Async operations for MCP server communications
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed external data

### Monitoring
- Track external service latency and reliability
- Monitor MCP server health and availability
- Log integration failures for debugging

## Custom Integration Development

### Creating Custom Integrations
1. **Identify Integration Points**: Determine where external services enhance agent capabilities
2. **Design Interface**: Create clean abstractions for external service interactions
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for external service failures
4. **Testing**: Develop comprehensive tests including external service mocking

### Integration Testing
```python
import pytest
from src.orchestrator import MetaOrchestrator

@pytest.fixture
def mock_mcp_server():
    # Mock MCP server for testing
    pass

def test_agent_with_mcp_integration(mock_mcp_server):
    orchestrator = MetaOrchestrator()
    # Test agent execution with mocked external services
    pass
```

## Enterprise Integration Patterns

### API Gateway Integration
- Expose orchestrator capabilities through REST APIs
- Authentication and rate limiting for production use
- Request/response transformation for different clients

### Event-Driven Integration
- Trigger orchestrations from external events
- Publish results to message queues or event streams
- Asynchronous processing for long-running orchestrations

### Database Integration
- Persist orchestration results and quality metrics
- Historical analysis and trend tracking
- Configuration management and versioning
