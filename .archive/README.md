# Archive - Original Python Framework

This directory contains the original Python-based AI DevOps Framework that was replaced with the documentation-driven approach.

## What's Archived
- `src/` - Original Python orchestrator and agent loader
- `tests/` - Original test suite
- `demo.py` - Original demo script
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- Other Python-related files

## Why Archived
The original approach used:
- Complex Python classes and abstractions
- Mock outputs instead of real AI integration
- JSON agent configurations
- Over-engineered orchestration patterns

## New Approach
The repository now uses a documentation-driven approach where:
- Claude Code reads markdown documentation to become the meta-orchestrator
- Agents are defined as markdown persona documents
- No Python framework required
- Real AI coordination instead of mock outputs

## Reference Use
These files may be useful for:
- Understanding the original architecture concepts
- Referencing quality validation approaches  
- Seeing the evolution from framework to documentation-driven
- Implementation patterns that could be adapted

The new approach maintains the same core concepts (consultation vs production agents, orchestration patterns, quality validation) but implements them through Claude Code's natural capabilities rather than custom Python code.
