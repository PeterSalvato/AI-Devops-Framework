# Agent Relationship & Pattern Index

*This document captures the relationships, dependencies, coordination patterns, and connection discoveries between AI agents during actual project work.*

## Agent Authority & Decision Flow

### Decision Authority Hierarchy
- **Human**: Final authority on all architectural choices, technology preferences, business priorities
- **Security Consultant**: Veto authority on security implementations (non-negotiable compliance)
- **Senior Architect**: Technical authority over system design and integration decisions  
- **UX Strategist**: Authority over user experience flows and interface design patterns

### Proposal → Decision → Implementation Flow
1. **Consultation agents propose** technical options with trade-offs to human
2. **Human decides** on architectural approaches, technology choices, security standards  
3. **Decisions get codified** in conventions.md as binding standards
4. **Production agents implement** according to established conventions
5. **Patterns get documented** here in symbol-index.md for future coordination

## Agent Coordination Discoveries

### Successful Coordination Patterns
*[Discovered during actual project work - populated by Claude]*

**Pattern**: [Name of coordination approach]
- **Agents involved**: [Which agents participated]
- **Project context**: [What project/feature this worked on]
- **Coordination method**: [How they worked together]  
- **Success indicators**: [Why this approach was effective]
- **Reusability**: [When this pattern applies to future projects]

### Agent Dependency Mapping
*[Updated as dependencies are discovered during coordination]*

**Agent Dependencies Discovered**:
- **[Agent Name] → [Required Input From]**: [Specific dependency discovered]
- **[Agent Name] ↔ [Coordination With]**: [Bi-directional coordination needed]
- **[Agent Name] → [Provides To]**: [What this agent delivers to others]

### Cross-Agent Integration Points
*[Documented as integration challenges and solutions are discovered]*

**Integration Point**: [Specific coordination challenge]
- **Agents involved**: [Which agents needed to coordinate]
- **Challenge**: [What made coordination difficult]
- **Solution pattern**: [How coordination was achieved]
- **Future application**: [When to use this coordination approach]

## Connection Network Evolution

### Agent Relationship Strengths
*[Mapped as relationships prove effective or problematic]*

**Strong Coordination Pairs**:
- **[Agent A] + [Agent B]**: [Why they work well together]
- **[Agent C] + [Agent D]**: [What makes their coordination effective]

**Challenging Coordination Points**:  
- **[Agent X] ↔ [Agent Y]**: [What coordination challenges exist]
- **Resolution approach**: [How to handle this coordination challenge]

### Communication Flow Discoveries
*[Documented as effective communication patterns emerge]*

**Effective Communication Patterns**:
- **[Situation]**: [What type of project/challenge]  
- **Communication flow**: [How agents should communicate for this situation]
- **Key handoff points**: [Critical information transfer moments]
- **Success metrics**: [How to know communication is working]

## Project-Specific Pattern Learnings

### Authentication System Patterns
*[Example - to be populated with actual learnings]*

### API Development Patterns  
*[To be populated as API projects are completed]*

### Frontend Integration Patterns
*[To be populated as UI projects are completed]*

### Security Implementation Patterns
*[To be populated as security projects are completed]*

## Institutional Memory

### Repeated Decision Patterns
*[Track which human decisions tend to repeat across projects]*

**Decision Pattern**: [Type of recurring decision]
- **Frequency**: [How often this decision type occurs]
- **Common choice**: [What humans typically decide]
- **Context factors**: [When humans choose differently]
- **Convention status**: [Whether this is now codified]

### Agent Capability Evolution
*[Document how agent effectiveness changes over time]*

**Agent Improvement Observations**:
- **[Agent Name]**: [How performance/coordination has improved]
- **Coordination enhancement**: [How multi-agent work has gotten better]
- **Pattern recognition**: [What coordination patterns are becoming automatic]
