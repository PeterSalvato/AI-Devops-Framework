# Project Outputs Directory

This directory contains **repo-style project folders** generated from AI agent coordination sessions. Each project is structured like a complete development repository with organized team deliverables.

## Structure

Each project gets its own **repository-style directory** with full development structure:

## Repository-Style Organization

### Why Repo Structure?
- **Complete projects**: Each output is a functional development repository
- **Team deliverables**: Clear ownership and handoff between consultation team leads and production specialists
- **Production ready**: Organized for immediate development work or deployment
- **Version control ready**: Structured for git initialization and team collaboration

### Project Categories
- **Feature implementations**: New functionality with full development structure
- **Architecture designs**: System design projects with specifications and prototypes  
- **Security audits**: Security analysis projects with testing and compliance deliverables
- **Code reviews**: Analysis projects with recommendations and improvement plans

### Coordination Benefits
- **Clear ownership**: Each directory shows which team lead and specialists contributed
- **Complete context**: All requirements, analysis, and implementation in one repository
- **Session persistence**: Projects continue across multiple Claude Code sessions
- **Quality tracking**: Clear record of decisions, validation, and sign-offs
