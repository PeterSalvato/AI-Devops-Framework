# Business Requirements: User Authentication System

*Original human requirements and business context for the authentication system project.*

## Project Context

**Date**: September 2024  
**Requestor**: Development Team Lead  
**Business Need**: Secure user authentication system for customer portal with enterprise security standards  
**Timeline**: 3 weeks for MVP, 2 weeks for production hardening  

## Original Human Request

> "We need a secure authentication system for our new customer portal. Users should be able to register and login with email/password, but we also want social login options like Google and GitHub. Admin users need stronger security - maybe 2FA. The system needs to be production-ready and handle a few thousand users initially, but should scale if we grow quickly."

## Human Decisions Made During Agent Consultation

### Authentication Architecture Decision
**Agent Proposals**:
- Senior Architect: "JWT vs session-based auth - JWT better for microservices but sessions better for traditional web apps"
- Security Consultant: "JWT with refresh tokens provides good security with scalability, but requires careful implementation"

**Human Decision**: "Use JWT with refresh token rotation - we're planning microservices architecture and need stateless auth"

### Social Authentication Decision
**Agent Proposals**:
- Senior Architect: "OAuth2 with Google, GitHub, Microsoft - these cover most business users"  
- UX Strategist: "Social login reduces friction but we need email/password option for users without social accounts"
- Security Consultant: "OAuth2 is secure but we need to validate implementation carefully"

**Human Decision**: "Implement OAuth2 with Google and GitHub first, add Microsoft later. Keep email/password as primary option"

### Multi-Factor Authentication Decision
**Agent Proposals**:
- Security Consultant: "TOTP is most secure and doesn't require SMS costs, hardware keys most secure but expensive"
- UX Strategist: "TOTP apps like Google Authenticator are common, but need good onboarding flow"

**Human Decision**: "TOTP 2FA required for admin users, optional for regular users. Use QR codes for setup"

### Technology Stack Decision
**Agent Proposals**:
- Senior Architect: "Node.js + Express for API, React for frontend, PostgreSQL for user data"
- Security Consultant: "This stack has good security libraries and is well-understood by team"

**Human Decision**: "Approved - matches our existing technology expertise and deployment infrastructure"

## Business Requirements

### Core Functionality  
- **User Registration**: Email-based registration with email verification
- **User Login**: Email/password authentication with "remember me" option
- **Social Login**: OAuth2 integration with Google and GitHub  
- **Password Management**: Password reset via email, password change functionality
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA, required for admin users

### Security Requirements
- **Data Protection**: All user data encrypted in database, HTTPS enforcement
- **Session Security**: Secure session management, automatic timeout after inactivity
- **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout after failed attempts, rate limiting
- **Audit Trail**: Log all authentication events for security monitoring

### User Experience Requirements
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive access
- **Performance**: Fast login/registration (<2 seconds), minimal friction
- **Error Handling**: Clear, helpful error messages without exposing security details

### Administrative Requirements
- **User Management**: Admin interface to view, edit, and deactivate user accounts
- **Security Monitoring**: Dashboard showing login patterns, failed attempts, security events
- **Data Export**: GDPR-compliant user data export and account deletion
- **System Health**: Monitoring endpoints for operations team

## Business Constraints

### Timeline Constraints
- **MVP Deadline**: 3 weeks for core authentication functionality
- **Production Deadline**: 5 weeks for security hardening and admin features
- **Go-Live Date**: 6 weeks to integrate with customer portal launch

### Budget Constraints  
- **Development Resources**: 1 senior developer, 1 junior developer, part-time security review
- **Infrastructure Budget**: Must work within current AWS infrastructure, no additional services
- **Third-Party Costs**: Minimize external service dependencies, avoid SMS costs for 2FA

### Technical Constraints
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Must integrate with PostgreSQL database, Redis cache
- **Team Skills**: Node.js and React expertise available, Python/Java would require learning
- **Security Standards**: Must pass internal security review and external audit

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- **User Registration**: Users can create accounts and verify email addresses
- **Authentication**: Users can log in with email/password and social providers
- **Security**: Admin users required to use 2FA, all sessions properly secured
- **Administration**: Admin users can manage user accounts and view security logs

### Performance Success
- **Response Times**: Authentication endpoints respond in <200ms under normal load
- **Scalability**: System supports 5,000 registered users and 500 concurrent sessions
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability during business hours, graceful failure handling

### Security Success  
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Pass security scanning with no high-severity issues
- **Penetration Testing**: Pass manual security testing by internal security team
- **Compliance**: Meet GDPR requirements for user data handling and privacy
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all authentication and administrative actions

### Business Success
- **User Adoption**: 80%+ of users successfully complete registration and first login
- **Admin Efficiency**: Admin tasks (user management, security monitoring) can be completed efficiently
- **Integration Ready**: Authentication system integrates cleanly with customer portal
- **Future-Proof**: Architecture supports planned microservices expansion

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Mitigated through security-first development pattern and expert review
- **Performance Issues**: Mitigated through load testing and database optimization
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigated through clear API design and documentation

### Business Risks  
- **Timeline Pressure**: Managed through phased delivery and clear scope definition
- **Security Requirements**: Addressed through comprehensive security consultation and validation
- **User Experience**: Validated through UX strategist involvement and usability testing
