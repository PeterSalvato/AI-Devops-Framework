- **Security Consultant**: Assigned for authentication security and compliance
- **UX Strategist**: Assigned for user flows and accessibility requirements
- Updated project status to PLANNING with consultation team leads assigned

### Coordination Notes

## Session 2: Multi-Agent Consultation Phase  
**Date**: September 2-3, 2024  
**Consultation Team Lead Outputs**:

### Senior Architect Analysis
**Technology Stack Proposal**:
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (team expertise, good security libraries)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (existing team skills, mature ecosystem)
- Database: PostgreSQL (ACID compliance, JSON support for user metadata)
- Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens (stateless, microservice-ready)

**System Architecture**:  
- RESTful API design with clear authentication/authorization separation
- Database schema with proper normalization and indexing
- Caching strategy with Redis for session management and rate limiting

### Security Consultant Analysis
**Threat Model**: Authentication system targeting individual users and admin accounts
- **Attack Vectors**: Brute force, credential stuffing, session hijacking, privilege escalation
- **Security Requirements**: Password hashing (bcrypt), rate limiting, audit logging, HTTPS enforcement
- **Compliance Needs**: GDPR user data handling, security event logging

**Security Specifications**:
- JWT: 15-minute access tokens, 30-day refresh tokens with rotation
- 2FA: TOTP required for admin users, optional for regular users  
- OAuth2: Google and GitHub providers with proper scope limiting
- Session Management: Redis-backed with IP validation and timeout controls

### UX Strategist Analysis  
**User Flow Design**:
- Registration: Email verification → profile setup → optional 2FA enrollment
- Login: Email/password → 2FA (if enabled) → dashboard redirect
- Social Login: Provider selection → OAuth consent → account linking
- Password Recovery: Email reset → secure link → password change → re-authentication

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all authentication interfaces
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- Clear error messages without exposing security details

### Human Decision Session
**Consultation Proposals Presented to Human**:
- Architecture: Node.js + React stack vs Python + Vue alternatives
- Authentication: JWT vs session-based authentication  
- 2FA: TOTP vs SMS vs hardware keys
- OAuth: Google + GitHub vs broader provider support

**Human Decisions**:
- ✅ Node.js + React stack (team expertise alignment)
- ✅ JWT with refresh token rotation (microservice future-proofing)
- ✅ TOTP 2FA required for admins, optional for users (security + usability balance)
- ✅ Google + GitHub OAuth (covers target user base)

**Decision Codification**: Updated `conventions.md` with "JWT Authentication Standard" for future projects
